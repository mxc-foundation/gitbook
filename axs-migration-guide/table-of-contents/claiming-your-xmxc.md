# Claiming Your xMXC

If you had MXC on the DataDash app prior to September 14, 2023, you are eligible for an automatic swap of your MXC to xMXC. While the swap is automatic, you must claim the xMXC. Here are the steps in claiming your xMXC.

Cost: Less than $1 in zkEVM MXC

Time: Less than 2 minutes

You must have filled out the Google form and provided the correct information prior to September 14, 2023.&#x20;

4. If you are eligible for a claim, you will see the xMXC amount next to “Your balance of xMXC is:”
5. Click on “Claim xMXC” and follow the popup to complete the claim process.

DHX claim is currently not live and will be added in the future. Claiming DHX process is as similar as claiming xMXC. Once DHX claim is live, simply repeat the above steps and instead of clicking on “Claim xMXC”, click on “Claim DHX”.&#x20;

Keep in mind that you need xMXC, not MXC, to top up your fuel tank once the on-chain mining commences. For this reason, we highly recommend that you keep your xMXC with you at all times.
