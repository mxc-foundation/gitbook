# What is AXS

AXS is the new, decentralized mobile application to support the MXC ecosystem. Users are more than welcome to use traditional wallet services such as Metamask to explore the MXC ecosystem. However, AXS provides significant advantages such as having the MXC zkEVM and MXC Wannsee Testnet built directly into the wallet. Moreover, AXS shows a direct overview of your MXC zkEVM native assets automatically, compared to the manual input users would have to make when using Metamask.&#x20;
