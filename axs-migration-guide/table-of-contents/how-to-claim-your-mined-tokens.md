# How to Claim Your Mined Tokens

Your mined tokens (SENSOR and 2 more ISO tokens) are available to be claimed for 24 hours. The claim schedule follows the Epoch, which is 4 hours per Epoch. This means that you may claim your tokens every 4 hours, if you wish to claim them as often as possible. Tokens that have not been claimed for 6 Epochs (24 hours) will be added back to the mining pool.&#x20;

Each claim results in a gas fee, payable in zkEVM MXC.

Here is how to claim your mined tokens:&#x20;

1. In the miner view shown above, click on “View Epoch List”
2. Tap on “claim token”
3. Approve and submit the transaction
4. Now your mined tokens are available in your wallet
