# How to Participate in On-Chain Mining

All M2 Pro and NEO miners are able to participate in on-chain mining starting with M2 Pro from September 19, 2023 and NEO at a later date. As Meta-XP has been canceled due to the popular DAO vote, the new on-chain mining ensures that all miners can participate in decentralized, sustainable mining for as long as they wish.

In the new, on-chain mining, miners use xMXC as fuel and mine $SENSOR. Upon mining $SENSOR tokens, miners can choose to top up their secondary fuel tank with $SENSOR with a cap of 1,000% in order to mine even more $SENSOR tokens or they can choose to liquidate $SENSOR tokens. Either way, the miners’ actions are the only factor that determines the mined outcome.&#x20;

Here are the specific steps on how to onboard your miners and start mining. We highly recommend that you use your AXS app for this, as it will require camera access.

1. Open your AXS app and ensure that you have zkEVM MXC to pay as gas and xMXC to use as fuel
2. &#x20;Access On-Chain Mining ([https://mining.matchx.io](https://mining.mxc.com))&#x20;
3. Click on the plus icon\

4. &#x20;Allow access to the camera, and scan the QR code of your miner
5. Mint a hexagon (HEX). This step can be skipped if the geographical location of your miner is already minted as a hexagon. If not, you must mint a hexagon in order to bind to the geographical location.\

6. Follow the steps to confirm minting a miner NFT\

7. Once the minting is completed, you will see the newly minted miner NFT on your list\

8. Now, it is time to top up your miner fuel with xMXC. Select the miner you wish to fuel up with xMXC\

9. You will see a wallet address that starts with 0x under “ERC6551 Address”. You will also see “$XMXC / FuelTankSize” and a number underneath it such as “0.0 / 800”. In this case, you must send 800 xMXC to the wallet that starts with 0x under “ERC6551 Address”
10. Send the appropriate amount of xMXC to the address. The ERC6551 Address is a sub-account owned by the NFT. As the full owner of this NFT, you are also in control of this address. No one else controls this wallet on your behalf.
11. Tap the miner NFT again, and scroll to the bottom. Select “ISO Selected Reward Token”\

12. Choose up to 2 tokens to mine additionally
13. Now you are successfully participating in on-chain mining with your miner, mining $SENSOR and 2 additional tokens
