# Using MXC zkEVM: Obtaining zkEVM MXC for Gas via Bridge

As previously mentioned, all transactions on MXC zkEVM blockchain requires gas fee payable in MXC. The MXC in this case is not the ERC-20 MXC which is on Ethereum, but MXC token that has been “bridged” over from the Ethereum blockchain to the MXC zkEVM blockchain. You may not use the ERC-20 MXC as gas. You must bridge your MXC tokens from Ethereum (ERC-20) to MXC zkEVM to use as gas. To do so, follow these steps:

Cost: Less than $5 in Ethereum (ETH)

Time: Less than 2 minutes

1. Obtain ERC-20 MXC on any exchanges. All exchanges from which you may obtain MXC may be found on this list: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mxc#markets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mxc#markets)&#x20;
2. Top up your Metamask with ERC-20 MXC and Ethereum (ETH)
3. Head over to [https://erc20.mxc.com](https://erc20.mxc.com)&#x20;
4. Select “Bridge”

8. Now your wallet has MXC zkEVM native MXC tokens to be used as gas fee
