# Reason for MXC zkEVM Mainnet

At the center stage of this migration is the launch of the MXC zkEVM, an MXC-native blockchain network that is built as a Layer 3 solution on top of Arbitrum. Using MXC zkEVM introduces many benefits for the MXC community as it uses MXC as a gas fee token instead of Ethereum, which is the case for the Ethereum blockchain and Arbitrum blockchain as well. This introduces a whole new utility for the current MXC, ensuring that the demand for the MXC token is on par with the continued growth of the larger MXC ecosystem as a whole.&#x20;

While some may argue that all of MXCâ€™s native solutions could be live on the Ethereum or Arbitrum blockchain, this is simply not true. General dApps such as swap and XSD could work on those blockchains, however specific dApps such as RWA NFTs and on-chain mining connected to hardware miners would simply not be possible to operate on other L1 or L2 blockchains. This is the reason that MXC Foundation has decided to build our own native L3 blockchain.
