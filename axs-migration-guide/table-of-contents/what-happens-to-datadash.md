# What Happens to DataDash

As of the current moment, all but one server on DataDash is offline. The one online DataDash server will continue to be supported, as one of our institutional partners is an active user of the server to offer additional services to its business clients. This is mainly for IoT connectivity functions and is not related to mining, staking, bonding, or any actions that are related to cryptocurrency assets.&#x20;

Users are not able to access DataDash, and a full snapshot has already been taken. The MXC Foundation has the latest, most accurate information on all user account balances of all tokens and these tokens will be able to be claimed by the users. MXC balance claim via xMXC is already live at the moment, with DHX and BTC balance claims happening in the imminent future.&#x20;
