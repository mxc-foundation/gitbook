# What Happens to ERC-20 MXC on DataDash

There already are ungrounded rumors circulating about the MXC Foundation taking full custody of the ERC-20 MXC that the users deposited on DataDash. These rumors are simply false and maliciously fabricated.

100% of all ERC-20 MXC tokens are added to the MXC L3 Bridge in order to support the full cross-bridge function between MXC zkEVM MXC and ERC-20 MXC. The foundation keeps 0 ERC-20 MXC from the DataDash app.&#x20;
