# Editing Custom Gas Limit

When conducting any transactions on the MXC zkEVM blockchain, you may sometimes come across failed transactions or actions. In almost all cases, this has nothing to do with the blockchain itself and more to do with your individual gas setting. In simple terms, it may be that your wallet is sending transactions with too low gas fee, which is far below the average transaction gas fee and therefore not processed. In such a case, you must edit the custom gas limit on Metamask.&#x20;

Here is how to edit your custom gas limit:

1. Initiate a transaction (claim, swap, approve, etc)
2. When prompted about gas, click on “site suggested” (please note that for your wallet, this may say “Market”)\

4. Ensure that your Max base fee (GWEI) is higher than the current. If not, you may edit the amount. Priority fee (GWEI) is completely optional. You may need to edit your Gas limit manually in some cases\
