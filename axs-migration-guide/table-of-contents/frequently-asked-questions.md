# Frequently Asked Questions

1. I have not yet migrated my DataDash account. What should I do?\
   \
   As you may be aware, the migration from DataDash to the new AXS Wallet app has begun. We already sent emails to all users about this, but you may have missed it or it did not reach you due to technical issues.&#x20;

All of your tokens in DataDash are safe. MXC will assist you in migrating all of them (whether they were in your DD Fuel / Wallet / Stake / Bond) to an external wallet.

As per our official announcement, all you need to do is:

\
Send an email to hello@mxc.org from your DataDash login email address with the subject: "Transfer Request"

\
We'll reply with your unique code with everything you need for a smooth transfer. You do not need access to DataDash in order to fill in the migration form.

2. I made a mistake while submitting the form. What can I do?\
   \
   If it is still before the next migration execution date, please contact our support team at [hello@mxc.org](mailto:hello@mxc.org) and we will try our best to accommodate your request.\

3. What happens if I give you an incorrect wallet address (that is not compatible with zkEVM)?\
   \
   There are 2 possibilities. If you have submitted a wallet address that either does not start with 0x or does not have exactly 42 characters (standard Ethereum and EVM wallet address format), then our system detects these errors and deems these wallet addresses invalid. In such a case, your submission will be rejected and you can write to us at [hello@mxc.org](mailto:hello@mxc.org) .\
   \
   On the other hand, if you have submitted a wallet address that starts with 0x and has exactly 42 characters but does not belong to your self-custody (e.g. exchange wallet addresses, third-party service provider wallet addresses), then these wallets are submitted. As the migration process is completely on-chain, we do not have any power to revert the process. Hence, your tokens would be completely lost. Either way, please write to us at [hello@mxc.org](mailto:hello@mxc.org) so that we can investigate this issue further and work with you on possible solutions.\

4. If I have 2 miners with separate email addresses in Datadash, can the MXC from both miners be moved to the same (i.e. single) Metamask Wallet?\
   \
   Each email address in DataDash counts as an individual account. If you have submitted a form twice but indicated the same Metamask wallet address, then the MXC from both miner accounts will be available to be claimed by the same Metamask wallet address.\

5. If I have 2 DataDash accounts with the same email addresses but in different Supernodes, what happens? I only received one unique code.\
   \
   The migration process checks the email address for all Supernodes. Hence, you have received only one code. As long as you successfully fill out the form, all MXC belonging to the DataDash accounts under the same email address will be compiled and be claimable by a single Metamask wallet address.\

6. Can I request to have my MXC from one DataDash account be claimable by 2 separate Metamask wallets?\
   \
   No, this is not a possibility.\

7. Can I use my hardware wallet (e.g. Ledger Nano X) for the migration?\
   \
   Yes, but the claim portal does not natively support hardware wallets. You must import your hardware wallet to Metamask or AXS by providing the seed phrases of your hardware wallet. Then, you can use the imported hardware wallet via Metamask or AXS for the migration.\

8. I don’t know my zkEVM wallet address. Can I just submit a normal Ethereum address?\
   \
   The wallet addresses are the same for Ethereum and zkEVM. EVM stands for “Ethereum Virtual Machine” which relies largely on the Ethereum framework. Hence, your Ethereum wallet address is the same as the zkEVM wallet address.\

9. Wait, so we are using MetaMask now?\
   \
   Not quite. You will need to use MetaMask (or another zkEVM-compatible wallet) as a ‘middleman’ to migrate your tokens from DataDash to our new AXS app.

\
AXS will be used for:

* Your MXC, DHX & BTC tokens that were migrated from DataDash
* On-chain mining with your M2 Pro and/or NEO
* Our new range of dApps\


10. What will happen with BTC mining?\
    \
    Your balance of Bitcoin from DataDash will be claimable soon. Due to the technical nature of BTC, this takes a bit longer than the transfer of MXC & DHX.\
    \
    BTC mining will not be available on AXS as BTC’s blockchain is not compatible with zkEVM.\

11. Is this going to migrate all my tokens? What about fuel/staked/bonded tokens?\
    \
    Yes, all of your tokens (MXC, DHX & BTC) will be migrated. This includes all tokens from your DataDash wallet/fuel tank/bonds/locks/stakes. It will all be claimable through the wallet address you have provided.\

12. Do I have to migrate?\
    \
    Of course, you may choose to opt out of the transfer by simply not filling out the form.\


But you will need to migrate for the following purposes:

* Access to the tokens from your DataDash
* Continued mining with NEO / M2 Pro (now back and better than ever!)
* The new world of zkEVM and crypto dApps\


13. What’s the deal with the conversion ratio of MXC:xMXC? Why is it so low?\
    \
    The move to zkEVM means decentralization. Our community demanded it and we delivered it. This means that the swap ratio between MXC - xMXC is dynamic, and was sufficiently supported before being handed to the community. It now depends entirely on supply & demand. The ratio will change over time; how you take advantage of this is up to you!\

14. I have filled out the form correctly but on the claim portal, my MXC and DHX amounts are incorrect. What should I do?\


There is absolutely no need to worry. The migration is being completed in a staggered manner, starting with MXC migration first. Not all your MXC balance may be migrated at once, as first the spot wallet balance is migrated, then your staked and bonded amount, followed by fuel in your miners. After MXC migration has been completed, DHX migration will begin. \


If you see on the claim portal that your claimable balance is 0, here are possible solutions for you:&#x20;

* Make sure you are connected with the wallet address you have provided in the form
* Make sure you are using the MXC zkEVM mainnet
* Make sure you do have MXC in the DataDash

Once you have ensured these points, you will be able to come back to the claim portal at a later date to see your full, updated balance. Then, you may continue with the claim. We expect the full migration of the DataDash MXC balance of those people who have submitted the form successfully before the September 14th deadline to be completed by September 21, 2023.

If you see on the claim portal that your claimable balance is above 0, but not fully reflective of your total MXC balance on DataDash, here are possible solutions for you:

* Make sure you do not have any pending transactions on DataDash
* Make sure you are using the MXC zkEVM mainnet
* Make sure you are connected with the wallet address you have provided in the form

Once you have ensured these points, the remaining balance of your MXC in the DataDash account will be directly transferred in xMXC to the wallet address you have provided in the form. There is no need to come back to the claim portal. MXC Foundation fully covers the transaction cost in this regard.
