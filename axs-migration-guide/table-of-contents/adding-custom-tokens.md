# Adding Custom Tokens

If you are using the AXS app, you do not need to add custom tokens to see your balance. However, if you are using Metamask, you must add custom tokens to see your balance. Without adding custom tokens, you will not be able to do so. This, however, does not mean that the tokens are not in your wallet. The tokens are indeed in your wallet, yet your Metamask plugin simply does not show this. Follow these steps to add custom tokens.

1. On Metamask, make sure that you are on the MXC zkEVM blockchain network. Then, select “Tokens” and scroll down. Click on “Import tokens”
