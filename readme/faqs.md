**What is Miner Health?** \


**What tokens does the M2 Pro mine?**\
The M2 Pro is a multi-token miner and the leader in the world of IoT Mining.

The M2 Pro currently mines [$MXC Token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mxc/) and [$DHX / DataHighway ](http://www.datahighway.com/)token. [$BTC/Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) is currently under testing phase (DKPIII), which will end the 26th of February, and Polkadot will be launched in 2022. The mining process is planned to be simultaneous, cross token.

The M2 Pro will continue to add further tokens as we continue to spread across the globe. The uniqueness of the M2 Pro comes from the PoP or ‚ÄúProof Of Participation‚Äù model, allowing users who participate in the Global Data Network to profit from their network.

All the tokens can be mined altogether, and their rewards will be on top of the rewards for MXC mining.&#x20;

**How long will the M2 Pro mine for?**\
The MXC Foundation is committed to creating a vibrant data network. To do this, we must ensure that miners stay active. But how does MXC ensure that miners stay active?

By continuing the PoP process, it is in the interest of MXC, Miners, and the Data Community to keep the M2 Pro miners in operation for as long as possible. Our goal is to have this network fully self-sustainable, but we also realise this will take time; this is a journey we are prepared to walk together, with our miners and community.

With regard to the M2 Pro miner and the material and product itself, we expect our award-winning M2 Pro Miner to continue to function as a data network powerhouse for up to 10 years. That‚Äôs German engineering, that‚Äôs high-class materials, that‚Äôs MatchX quality!

**What is the 4th antenna and what are the benefits of using it?**\
The 4th antenna is a 4G/LTE antenna and it is only reccomended for people that do not use access to normal internet connectivity via router. This allows users to install miners even in remote locations. \
\
**Can I see my miners on a map?** \
We created MXCMapper for this! It gives you a clear overview of where the M2 Pros are located as well as other Gateways. You can find the map [here](https://mxcmapper.com/). \
\
**When will the next Discord AMA be?** \
We will make sure we give the community at least a week's advance notice before we host an AMA (on any platform). In addition to giving the community time to prepare, this will also allow everyone to submit questions ahead of time if necessary. Be sure to pay attention to the \
`#üî•Ô∏±announcementsÔ∏±üî•` channel to stay up to date with all upcoming events/announcements.\
\
**Where can I talk to a Team Member?** \
If you have a technical issue and you wish to speak with the Support Team, please use the [Matchx.io](https://matchx.io/pages/support) Technical Support Center, or the [Live Chat](https://matchx.io/). Team members are online between 9:00 and 18:00 CET (CEST) on business days (excluding public German holidays). If you wish to talk to us personally that is possible Bi-Weekly on Thursdays at 20:00 CET (CEST) in Discord. \
\
**How do I update the Support Ticket I launched using the Bot?** \
To update a past ticket, use the `/ticket update` command. The bot will then DM you and ask you to select the ticket you wish to update. \
\
**What is the grace period?** \
Your grace period begins the day and time the miner is first registered. It lasts for 90 days. During this period of time miner health will be updated accordingly to the PoP elements percentages of your miner, but it will have no effect on your earnings, which will stay as if your miner health is 100%. When the grace period ends, your miner health will be applied. So you‚Äôll want to be sure that your miner is nice and healthy before that grace period ends.\
\
**How does the M2 Pro work in the DataDash App?**\
The M2 Pro works seamlessly with the DataDash App. The DataDash App allows users to monitor their profits, adjust their mining and staking needs, and withdraw their mined/staked tokens. DataDash is a sleek and super simple app that allows users to not only mine MXC with the M2 Pro, but also allows users to mine multiple tokens.\
\
The MXC Foundation will continue to develop a wide range of ‚Äúon the go‚Äù products, which will integrate with the DataDash App. We look forward to building the DataDash App into a hub for tokens, mining, data trading, and the functional usage of M2 Pro devices and sensors, with the ability to monitor, control, and profit from their data and general functionality.\

**LPWAN Regional Parameters**\
LPWAN operates in an unlicensed frequency spectrum in sub-gigahertz range. Although it is unlicensed which means the user doesn't have to apply for permission to transmit and pay huge license fees, it is still regulated and everyone needs to follow the rules imposed by the radio communication authorities of the given country where the device operates. Because unlicensed spectrum is a common good, following the rules ensures that no single entity will prohibit others from accessing it. Another example of an unlicensed spectrum is 2.4GHz and 5GHz used by WiFi, Bluetooth and many other protocols. LPWAN prefers using sub-gigahertz frequencies because it allows for communication over longer distances but because of this longer propagation, the regulations are stricter than short range communication bands. To make things even more complicated different authorities impose different rules, and allocate different bands depending on the region. To help all LPWAN adopters to navigate this complicated labyrinth of rules, a common framework has been developed by the Lora Alliance and is published in a document called the Regional Parameters available on their [website](https://lora-alliance.org/lorawan-for-developers).\
\
MXC Supernode servers are designed and configured to comply with the Regional Parameters guidelines, nonetheless they don't define all aspects LPWAN communication and still leave some freedom to network server operators in regards to the specific channel bands, number of channels and other parameters. For example US902-928 region specification used in USA and other regions respecting FCC authority defines 64 possible frequencies channels that can be used by devices but most of existing LPWAN Gateways can only use 8 or 16 of those channels and it is up to the network operator to chose which one to use.
