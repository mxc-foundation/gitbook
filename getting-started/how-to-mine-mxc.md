# How to mine MXC

Our own MXProtocol based upon the Proof of participation consensus mechanism has made mining super simple, easy to start, and open to everyone! Nodes mining performance is based on participation principles in constructing a decentralized, widespread, and secure LPWAN network.\


Of course, it's very complex on our side, but we made sure to keep everything smooth with a simple plug n play on your side. Follow the following steps, and within four minutes, you will already be mining.&#x20;



## &#x20;Prereqs:

* [x] Own at least one M2 Pro
* [x] Stable internet connection

## Steps to follow:

* Setup your miner. _**How to set up a miner:**_
  1. Once you receive your miner, ensure all components are in the box.
  2. Remove the screws from the bottom of your M2 Pro miner and take off the back cover.
  3. Download and install MXC Data Dash App
  4. Once installed, please register your account using your email address and check your email to verify.
  5. Register the miner on the app by simply scanning the QR code present on the backside of your M2 Pro using your email address
  6. Once logged in, immediately **set up the 2FA**, and write down your mnemonic phase.
  7. Install the antenna corresponding to each letter mentioned on the antennas
  8. Connect the first ethernet cable to the M2 Pro and POE port of your power supply&#x20;
  9. Connect the second ethernet cable to the LAN port of your power supply and your internet connection like your modem or wifi router
  10. Connect the power cable to the power supply, and your M2 Pro is all set to start mining!
* Select a supernode based upon your region - for instance, for Europe; it is MatchX.
* Install your M2 Pro vertically to ensure the peak coverage to the network
* Ensure that your health scores remain high to have more participation on the network and thus higher mining performance.
* Check the led light at the miner's bottom, and it needs to show green, which shows you are successfully mining MXC.&#x20;



You can start mining with the use of MatchX fabulous M2 Pro! It's the first Multi-Token Miner that works on Low-Power (around 1/5th of an average lightbulb), so that's barely any power!
