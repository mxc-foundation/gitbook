The steps on how to buy $MXC from the exchanges are pretty straightforward. Firstly you need to create an account on the exchange in order to trade any cryptocurrencies. After registering you can deposit your desired funding stream, whether this is already owned crypto or Fiat from your Bank Account. After depositing you can simply buy MXC via the trading pairs accordingly. \
\
If you don't want to create an account on an exchange you can simply use Uniswap. However, Uniswap required an already existing crypto wallet, so you need to deposit to your crypto wallet first before swapping with MXC.\

\
After swapping you can see your MXC Balance on the wallet that you've connected to Uniswap. Now you are ready to deposit your crypto to the DataDash App.\
\
If you have MXC on any exchange or on any crypto wallet you can withdraw that MXC and move it towards the DataDash App with your DataDash Deposit Address.\
\
To find your DataDash MXC deposit address you first need to [download the DataDash App](https://www.mxc.org/datadash)\
After downloading you can create your account and login accordingly. When you have done this you can see MXC on your Home screen. If you click on MXC you will see the "Deposit" button on the top left. Once you click on that you can see your MXC deposit address.\
\
Now that you have a destination for your MXCs to the DataDash App you simply withdraw from the exchange you chose or from your crypto wallet and transfer the MXCs to the DataDash App. They should arrive within 30 block confirmations (between 5 and 30 minutes).\
\
Congratulations! You now have bought and transferred MXC towards the DataDash App.\
