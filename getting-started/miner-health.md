# Miner Health

Miner Health is all about decentralizing the network and thus empowering everyone, yes, even those in the most remote areas of the world. \
\
In almost all mining models, a term called "halving" is hardcoded into the development code, giving miners no choice other than to see their influence on the network reduce over time. \
\
Miner Health avoids the need for halving, ensuring miners can continue to mine and carry influence at a pace that they choose. Without Miner Health, such robust network stability would not be sustainable. \
\
Our focus for Miner Health is to make the preparatory step for the global data network â€” this is how blockchain technology meets and solves real-world applications.\

**Miner Health** is the way to keep track of your M2 Pro Miner's optimal potential in the DataDash App. Currently, by just keeping your M2 Pro:

* Powered on
* Online
* Allowing your mined MXC to accumulate as **Fuel**

You will be optimizing your M2 Pro's health and thus your miner's performance. In the future, other Miner Health criteria will be introduced which will impact Health and miner performances if those are not optimized, these can include:

* Elevation
* GPS Signal Strength
* Proximity to other M2 Pro miners
* Orientation (i.e. keeping your miner upright)
