# How to stake MXC

You already know how to buy MXC and how to Deposit the MXCs to the DataDash App. The next step is to stake the MXC to increase the Network strength and activity for the ecosystem!\
\
Staking MXC can be done via the Home Screen on the DataDash App or via the Wallet tab, it will bring you to the same page. On the top of the page you can see "Deposit", "Withdraw" and "Stake".\
\
When you click on Stake you can add a "new stake". You are then asked for the duration of Stake you want to go for.&#x20;

You will receive the staking rewards every 30 days after the start of the stake, and you can calculate the rewards you'd get simply clicking on the duration and see the monthly rate. For example, the 24 Month Stake will give you 0.7% of the staked amount per month, for an APY of 8.4%.\
\
The longer your staking period the better your "Staking Boost". This is for you to decide upon. \
When you chose your staking duration you can add the amount of MXC you wish to stake towards that period. After that you only have to "Confirm your Stake" and you are now staking MXC on the DataDash App!\
