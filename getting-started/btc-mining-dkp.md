# BTC Mining (DKP)

The Das Kaiser Project, also known as 'DKP', is the testnet we use verify the consistency and the quality of the Bitcoin Mining feature. Before updating the DataDash app with a new feature we always make sure it contains no bugs so that the user may have a flawless experience with it. For this reason, we run the testnets where users may participate in it and help the MXC Foundation ensure quality and reliability.

The DKP has had three rounds so far, but the rundowns of the first two weren't satisfying enough for the Foundation. Some discrepancies were found, and a third round was necessary. The third round lasted about three months, starting from the 1st of December until the 26th of February.

The third round of the DKP also added two requirements to participate: a lock of 6000 MXC in the BTC section of the DataDash App, and a miner with 90% or more health. One would have to go on the homepage, then click "Add token", choose "BTC", then click on "BTC" that now appears on the list of the tokens on the DataDash app, and lastly to click on the top button "Lock MXC". There, if a miner is eligible for mining, so to say with 90% or more health, and if the wallet of the owner has at leat 6000 MXC, a button to start BTC mining with the specific miner will be available.&#x20;

If one owns more than one miner, they can decide which miner will mine Bitcoin. One can mine with all the miners they have, if all the miners have 90% health and there is enough MXC to be locked for it.

Locking the MXC for the testnet creates a lock of 90 days. The lock expires after 90 days, even if the testnet ends before the 90 days. After 90 **full** days have passed, the lock will end, and the tokens will be put back on the wallet.

After the end of the testnet on the 26th of February, the team will take some time to analyze the results, work out all the kinks and flaws, and if it passes the standards of the MXC Foundation the BTC mining feature will be permanent.

There is no ETA on this, as this is not something they can foresee: working out bugs is not a task where they can give out estimates. Please, be patient about this, the team is working hard to make the feature go live as soon as possible. We thank you in advance for your cooperation.
