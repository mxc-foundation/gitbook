# Miner Proximity

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>)

The new miner protocol proximity update has been decided after taking the intensive feedback from the community, supporters, and investors to empower the miner community to grow extensively and support the miners who have multiple units within the exact location. This new proximity update feature will spread the M2 Pro miners worldwide in a decentralized manner.&#x20;



The initial mining proposal allowed one miner per 50 meters (165 feet) diameter. Previously, another miner being placed within this vicinity would then have their mining power reduced by 7%, and so forth. The new update is expected to be active **around March 2022** and will no longer affect miners that are too close to each other. \


The entire globe is divided into small hexagons with a diameter of 2KM (1KM Radius). Within those hexagons, one can deploy up to 10 M2 Pro Miners, which will have no influence/impact on their mining performance. However, an additional miner in the same area will do result in a reduction of mining performance. For example, the 11th Miner within that same hexagon (depending on the fuel of that Miner) will be affected by a 20% health reduction, the 12th Miner by 40%, and so on.&#x20;



**Note:** The principal is entirely based on the miner fuel tank size. Thus, priority mining will be rewarded to those miners who have more "total tokens" in their fuel tank.  \
