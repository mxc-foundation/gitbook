# The 2022 Roadmap

2021 was a massive successive year in terms of growth of the Data Republic network and exploring new partnership deals in terms of usage of that network. The growth has been hyper exponential in terms of deployments of nodes globally, covering many entire countries in Europe and significant areas in the US, exceeding all the highest predication made for the year. In addition, many exciting companies joined the MXC Foundation, like Careband, to test the decentralized and fair trade network, and many more are in negotiation in terms of provisioning their devices on our network-

With the end of 2021, the year 2022 has made us in a perfect position even to achieve a higher milestone and deliver unique big plans for the community to experience even further multi-token mining experiences and for expansion towards usage of the network. So here you find some big rollouts plan for this year:
