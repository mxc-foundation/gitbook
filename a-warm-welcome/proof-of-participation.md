# Proof of Participation

The proof of participation model is the consensus mechanism, which is the core of our Machine Exchange Protocol or MXProtocol, ensuring the deployment of LPWAN technology to create decentralized data republic network. Furthermore, our Proof-of-Participation (PoP) model allows the data packet to be efficiently and reliably connected over extremely long distances with very minimal energy consumption.

Proof Of Participation Model ensures MXProtocol remains a robust, economically, and environmentally friendly Data Protocol allowing the nodes created network to remain stable, irrespective of the growth of users during our global adoption movement. Thus, simultaneously rewarding the mining community for their active participation in the network.

The nodes or M2 Pro miners are awarded through this PoP consensus model, ensuring that the user commits to the created network. In this manner, the POP model improves network distribution and security. It recognizes the node's or miners' utility contribution based on the participative elements of each miner on the network.

The POP consensus mechanism has made the M2 Pro miner easy to use. It is developed to be a simple and plug n play hardware, allowing anyone to join the mining community. This is of great importance because it takes lots of hassle away for the "non-technical" consumers by being easy to use.

We at MXC Foundation believe crypto mining should be easy and accessible to everyone. The M2 Pro miner has led to its brilliant success. Now that we are building this robust network together, we're looking at building devices to go onto this network, and this all has been made simple with our state of art POP model.
