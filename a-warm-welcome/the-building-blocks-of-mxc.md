# The Building Blocks of MXC

MXC Foundation is the first in the IoT and blockchain industry that works with the Proof-of-Participation consensus mechanisms, having the first-mover advantage. MXC is a novel ERC-20 blockchain cryptocurrency specializing in IoT-Machine to Machine Data Transactions. MXC token is uniquely fashioned built for the future of IoT and LPWAN technology.&#x20;

MXC Foundation enables the scalability of the data republic network for IoT / Data-devices that can communicate with each other and ensure end-to-end encryption and an uninterpreted environment, thus laying the foundations of "Sharing Economy."&#x20;

At MXC Foundation, we created a state-of-the-art MXProtocol entirely based on Proof of Participation guidelines, which plays a massive role in the MXC Ecosystem. The MXProtocol empowers the MXC Foundation shared data network for any smart or IoT Provider to connect their devices seamlessly and ensure the highest security protocol to permit permissionless and independent communication between devices.&#x20;

If you haven't heard about MXProtocol before, a great place to start is at the [MXProtocol Page.](broken-reference)

The MXProtocol empowers the MXC Foundation to take the physical world hardware into MXC Metaverse to ensure the expansive growth of the data republic network. The MXC Foundation intends to create something that has never been done before, MXC Metaspace, where the community experiences living in the internet.&#x20;

Connecting devices flow in our blood as smart cities are no more uncertain future. MXC serves as a foundational layer for fair and pure decentralized IoT Data Networks. At MXC, we believe in community empowerment and complete transparency!&#x20;
