# ðŸ§™â™‚ Pool Prefilling

Pool Prefilling is a process where a portion of the MXC supply is initially allocated to the Community Treasury Pool to ensure there is sufficient liquidity for miners. The goal of pool prefilling is to maintain a healthy and stable ecosystem for miners to reap benefits and continue mining.

During the initial stage, the Community Treasury Pool will receive a pre-set amount of MXC tokens. This pre-set amount will be determined by the Foundation, and it will be used to support the community pool's liquidity needs. This pre-set amount will be used to ensure that miners who wish to withdraw their token shares from the pool have sufficient liquidity available to do so.

After the initial stage has kicked off, the community pool will start accumulating fees from the different sources mentioned earlier. The collected fees will then be used to replenish the poolsâ€™ liquidity, which ensures that miners can continue their mining operations without any delay or restrictions.

Pre-filling the pool with MXC tokens is crucial for ensuring that miners can confidently participate without the fear of insufficient liquidity in the pool. By taking advantage of this opportunity to contribute to the community pool, miners can also benefit from the potential appreciation of MXC's value. So don't miss out on this chance to not only participate in the global data network of MXC but also reap the benefits in the future!
