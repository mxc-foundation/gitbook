# 🐕 Dogecoin Mining

Continuing the low-power, multi-token mining tradition, NEO is eligible to mine Dogecoin (DOGE) on top of mining MXC. Dogecoin mining is strictly reserved for the miners in the OG tier. The DOGE mined is contributed directly from the Bitcoin mining farm partner in Michigan that is co-heading the mining infrastructure building with MXC. The amount of DOGE contributed toward the mining pool fluctuates on a non-regular basis, dependent on the overall performance of the mining farm partner.&#x20;
