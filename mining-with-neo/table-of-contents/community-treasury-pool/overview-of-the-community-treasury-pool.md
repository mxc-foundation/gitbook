# ðŸŽ± Overview of the Community Treasury Pool

The Community Treasury Pool is a pool of funds that are collected from various fees and contributions within the MXC ecosystem. These funds are then used to support the development of the MXC Network by supporting the miners who participate in the pool. The benefits are distributed proportionally to the amount of dedication of the individual miner. In other words, miners who contribute more to the network have higher distributive benefits from the pool, thus a larger share of the fees collected in the treasury pool.

Below you can see the full breakdown of the fees collected that are accumulating in the Community Treasury Pool:

**Withdrawal fees for MXC Mining**: When a miner withdraws their MXC tokens from their mining account, a withdrawal fee of 2.83% is charged, along with the relevant gas fee. The entirety of the withdrawal fee is contributed toward the community treasury.
