# Bonding

One of the most important requirements for operating a NEO miner is bonding. Bonding refers to the process of locking up a certain amount of tokens as collateral. This collateral is used to ensure that miners act in the best interest of the network and do not engage in any malicious behavior.

The amount of tokens required for bonding varies depending on the tier level of the miner. For Gold tier miners, the minimum bonding amount is 5,000 MXC tokens for the initial 12960 blocks, with a reoccurring bonding requirement of 1500 MXC every 4320 blocks. For Silver tier miners, the minimum bonding amount is 3,000 MXC tokens for the initial 12960 blocks, with a reoccurring bonding requirement of 1000 MXC every 4320 blocks. And for Bronze tier miners, there is no minimum bonding requirement.
