# Other Requirements

In addition to bonding and good health conditions, there are other requirements that miners must meet. These include:

* Validating the latest version of the NEO protocol
* Maintaining up-to-date security measures to prevent hacking attempts
* Maintaining reliable uptime to support the network

Overall, meeting the tier requirements for operating a NEO miner is essential for ensuring the security and stability of the network. By bonding a certain amount of MXC tokens, maintaining good health conditions, and meeting other requirements, miners can help to ensure that the MXC blockchain remains secure and reliable.
