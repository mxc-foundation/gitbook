# ðŸ›« Migration Between Tiers

Moving between tiers is an important aspect of the NEO mining principle that allows users to adjust their bond based on their individual needs and preferences. Whether you are looking to increase or decrease your bonded amount or move to a different tier altogether, NEO offers a seamless and flexible process for transitioning between tiers.

To move between tiers, the first step is to determine which tier you want to move to. NEO offers three different tiers - Bronze, Silver, and Gold - each with different bond requirements and value opportunities. Once you have decided which tier you want to move to, you can initiate the transition process by following a few simple steps.

To move up a tier, you must first meet the bond requirement for the higher tier. For example, if you want to move from Bronze to Silver, you must have a minimum bond amount equal to the Silver tier requirement. Once you have met this requirement, you can request to move to the Silver tier via the DataDash App.

Moving down a tier is also possible, but it requires a bit more planning. If you want to move down a tier, you must first wait for your current bond period to end. Once the bond period is over, you can then choose to unbond your tokens and move to a lower tier or withdraw them from the DataDash platform altogether.

It's important to note that moving down a tier may result in a reduction in mining outcome, so it's important to carefully consider your options before making any changes. Additionally, some health conditions may affect your ability to move between tiers.

In summary, moving between tiers is a simple and flexible process that allows users to adjust their bond investments to better suit their individual needs and preferences. Whether you are looking to increase or decrease your bond amount or move to a different tier altogether, the NEO algorithm makes it easy to transition between tiers and continue unlocking benefits in the process.
