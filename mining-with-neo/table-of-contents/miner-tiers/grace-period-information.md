# ðŸ˜‡ Grace Period Information

The Grace Period refers to a specific time frame given to miners who have reached the end of their chosen bond duration.&#x20;

Upon the expiration of their original bond duration - whether new or recurring - the miners who have chosen the auto-renewal option for their tier yet do not have an available balance in their wallet, or those who have not chosen auto-renewal, are granted 144 blocks to renew their tiers. During these 144 blocks, the miners will continue mining in their chosen tiers. Upon the completion of the 144 blocks grace period, the miner will either stay in the tier or automatically move to Bronze, depending on what the miner has chosen to do during the 144 blocks.&#x20;
