# üîÅ Bond Continuation Scenarios (Silver, Gold)

Bond Continuation Scenarios in Silver and Gold tiers are the requirements for miners to continue their participation in the higher tiers of the MXC Network. In the Silver tier, miners must have a minimum of 75% health and bond a minimum of 3,000 MXC for 12960 blocks, with an additional 1,000 MXC reoccurring bond per 4320 blocks to stay in the tier. If a miner's health drops below 75%, they will be moved to the Bronze tier. Any miner who returns to the Silver tier must bond 3,000 MXC for 12960 blocks again. If a miner fails to renew their bond, they will be moved to Bronze and must bond again to return to the Silver tier.

In the Gold tier, miners must have a minimum of 95% health and bond a minimum of 5,000 MXC for 12960 blocks to enter the tier. After that, they must bond an additional 1,500 MXC per 4320 blocks to stay in the tier. Like in the Silver tier, the bonds are recurring, and miners who return to the Gold tier must bond 5,000 MXC for 12960 blocks again.

At the expiration of the bond cycle, miners who have not opted in to auto-renewal or those who have yet to have insufficient balance in their wallet are granted a grace period of 144 blocks to manually renew their bond. When the 144th block is mined and no action has been taken, the miner will automatically exit the tier and enter Bronze tier.&#x20;

Miners' participation in higher tiers is determined by their health, which is calculated based on various factors, including how long they have been mining in the network, and their mining power, which is determined by a formula that incorporates their health, staking factor, and age factor.
