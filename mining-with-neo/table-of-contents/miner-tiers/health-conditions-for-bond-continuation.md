# ❤ Health Conditions for Bond Continuation

To ensure that the network is operating at an optimal level, miners must maintain a certain level of health to continue in their respective tiers. Health levels are based on the miner’s contribution to the network and their ability to maintain their equipment. If a miner falls below the required health level, they will be moved to Bronze tier automatically.&#x20;

The health level for each tier is as follows:

* Bronze: No minimum health level required
* Silver: Minimum of 75% health required
* Gold: Minimum of 95% health required

To maintain their health level, miners must complete health checks regularly. Health checks are conducted by the network and measure a miner's contribution to the network, equipment status, and other factors that affect the miner's ability to operate.&#x20;

Additionally, if a miner experiences a hardware failure or other issue that affects their ability to contribute to the network, they must inform the network immediately and take appropriate action to resolve the issue. If the issue is not resolved within a reasonable time frame, the miner will be moved down a tier.

Overall, maintaining a healthy and reliable mining operation is critical to the success of the MXC network, and to your mining, and all miners must take responsibility according to their Proof-of-Participation.
