# ðŸ§± Overview of the Miner Tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold and OG)

The Miner Tiers are a system of categorizing miners in the MXC network based on their performance and contributions to the network. There are four tiers in total: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and OG. Each tier represents a higher level of commitment and contribution to MXCâ€™s Global Data Network.\
\
Bronze is the lowest level tier, it represents the bare minimum contribution towards the network. Silver represents the entry-tier level, once you start mining with the NEO the silver tier is where you begin, in addition to the tier, silver has a greater amount of mining activity than bronze. Gold represents an even higher level of commitment and contribution, and OG represents the highest tier, reserved for the most dedicated and experienced miners in the network.

Each tier has its own requirements for bonding, health conditions, and other factors that determine a miner's eligibility to participate in that tier. Miners are incentivized to move up to higher tiers by receiving higher outcomes for their mining activity, and by gaining access to more advanced features and tools in MXCâ€™s ecosystem.

Moving up through the tiers requires miners to meet certain performance metrics and maintain a high level of activity and contribution to the network. The process of moving between tiers is designed to be fair and transparent, and it is based on a combination of factors, including mining activity, bonding, and other performance metrics.

The Miner Tiers system is designed to encourage and award miners who are committed to supporting the MXC network and contributing to its growth and development. By incentivizing miners to achieve higher levels of performance and contribution, the network is able to expand and improve, providing better coverage and more reliable connectivity for MXC users around the world.
