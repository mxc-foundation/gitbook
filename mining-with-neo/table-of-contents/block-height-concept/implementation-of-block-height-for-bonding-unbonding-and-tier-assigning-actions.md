# ðŸ’» Implementation of Block Height for Bonding, Unbonding, and Tier Assigning Actions

The Block Height Concept is also relevant in the bonding and unbonding actions on the NEO blockchain. Bonding is the process of adding tokens to a Miner's balance to increase their Mining Tier. Unbonding is the opposite process, where a Miner removes their tokens from their balance, resulting in a decrease in their Mining Tier.

The NEO also uses the Block Height Concept to track the duration of bonds accurately. Instead of using days or months, the network uses the Block Height Concept to track the duration of the bond. This approach ensures that the network can accurately calculate the outcome for Miners based on the duration of their bond.

The Tier Assigning Actions on the NEO also rely on the Block Height Concept. The Tier System is a mechanism that incentivizes Miners to participate in the network and reflects value to them for their contributions. The Tier System assigns Miners a Tier based on the amount of tokens they hold and their performance on the network. The higher the Tier, the more significant the opportunities.\
