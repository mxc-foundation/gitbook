# ‚è≥ Time Stamps for Block Height and Transactions

The Block Height Concept is also relevant to time-stamping transactions on the network. Each block on the blockchain has a timestamp that represents the time when the block was created. The Block Height Concept is used to track the order of blocks and transactions, enabling the network to ensure that each transaction is processed accurately and securely.

The timestamp of each block is also relevant for tracking the age of a bond. When a Miner bonds tokens, the network uses the timestamp of the block to calculate the duration of the bond accurately. This approach ensures that the Miner receives the correct value for the duration of their bond, without any discrepancies or errors.

In conclusion, the Block Height Concept is a fundamental aspect of blockchain technology and plays a critical role in ensuring the validity and integrity of the blockchain. For NEO, the Block Height Concept is essential for tracking the current state of the blockchain accurately and maintaining the stability and security of the network. By implementing the Block Height Concept for bonding, unbonding, and tier assigning actions, the network can accurately calculate the receiving value for Miners based on the duration of their bond and incentivize them to participate in the network. The time-stamping of transactions using the Block Height Concept enables the network to ensure that each transaction is processed accurately and securely, ensuring the overall integrity of the blockchain.
