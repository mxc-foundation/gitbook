# ðŸ—’ Definition and Explanation

The Block Height Concept is an essential aspect of the internal blockchain used by the MXC Supernodes. It plays a critical role in ensuring the validity and integrity of the internal blockchain. The Block Height refers to the current block number in the blockchain and represents the distance of each block from the genesis block. The height of the blockchain is the number of blocks in that blockchain, and the height of a block is its distance from the genesis block.

For example, when a new block is created on the blockchain, its height is one greater than the previous block, and it includes a unique block hash that references the previous blockâ€™s hash. This linking of blocks forms a chain that makes tampering with the internal blockchain extremely difficult, as any changes to one block will affect all subsequent blocks.

In the context of the MXC Supernodes, the Block Height Concept is used to track the progress of the blockchain and ensure that all nodes are in agreement about the current state of the blockchain. This allows for a decentralized consensus to be reached about the validity of transactions and blocks added to the blockchain. The Block Height is also used to determine the proximity factor, which is a measure of how close a miner is to the current block height and affects their chances of being selected to mine the next block.

Overall, the Block Height Concept is a crucial aspect of blockchain technology that ensures the security and validity of the internal blockchain used by the MXC Supernodes.
