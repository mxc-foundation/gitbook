We hope that you found the information provided here helpful and informative.

Throughout this Gitbook, we have covered a range of topics, from the basics of the MXC network and the NEO miner to more advanced concepts such as miner tiers, DOGE mining, and block rings. Our goal was to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the NEO miner and how it fits into the larger MXC ecosystem.

If you do not yet have a NEO miner and are interested in purchasing one, we encourage you to visit [\[this link\]](https://matchx.io/pages/neo?utm\_source=Gitbook\&utm\_medium=NEO\&utm\_campaign=Tracking) to learn more. With its low power consumption, portability, and compatibility with the MXC network, the NEO miner is an excellent choice for those looking to take advantage of the global data network and benefit from Web3, IoT, and Data Verification services.
