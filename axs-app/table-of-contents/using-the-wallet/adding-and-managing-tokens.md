# Adding and Managing Tokens

By default, the AXS app has a few major assets already added. However, if you are looking for a specific token, you may be required to add the token yourself in order to see the balance reflected on your wallet.

To add a token, scroll down on the tokens view on your wallet. Click on “Add token” and fill in relevant details. The details should be available either on the token’s smart contract page on the MXC Explorer or you may obtain these directly from the owner of the smart contract.\
