# Sending and Receiving Funds

To send and receive tokens, click on the balance of your wallet. Then, you can choose to send either tokens or NFTs by tapping on the relevant category and “send”. If you are receiving assets, click on “receive” and you will be able to see either the QR code to your wallet or your wallet address.
