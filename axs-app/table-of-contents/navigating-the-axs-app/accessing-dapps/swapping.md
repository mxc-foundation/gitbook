# Swapping

The Swapping feature within the AXS App provides users with a streamlined and effortless way to exchange cryptocurrencies. Users can select their preferred tokens for buying or selling, making trading a straightforward process. Additionally, users can participate as liquidity providers by depositing tokens into liquidity pools, contributing to the overall marketplace liquidity. In return, liquidity providers earn a percentage of passive income generated from trading fees, adding an appealing incentive to support the ecosystem.
