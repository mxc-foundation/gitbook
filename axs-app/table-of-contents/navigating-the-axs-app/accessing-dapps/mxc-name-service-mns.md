# MXC Name Service (MNS)

MXC Name Service (MNS) is a domain that ends with .mxc that can be used as a more easily readable wallet address. Hence, instead of sharing wallet addresses that start with 0x and followed by a random string of numbers and letters, you can simply share an MNS such as yourname.mxc. When the sender sends supported currencies to your MNS (yourname.mxc), it will automatically land in your original wallet (that starts with 0x).&#x20;
