# Main Dashboard

In the main dashboard view, you can see the entire overview of the dApps that are currently available. In the dashboard, you will be able to fully customize it by dragging and dropping certain dApps to make the entire display unique and catered to your liking. Long-press on any dApp to start the editing process, you will see a “+” and a “done” button on the top-left and right corners of your screen. You can now add any dApp supported by MXC zkEVM.
