# Security Settings

On security settings, you can change the passcode (the 6-digit passcode you set up when you were signing up for AXS). This does not change any other details of your account.

You may also clear the browser history and cookies. This is particularly handy if you encounter certain bugs or lags, or if you are looking for a more updated version of the dApp.

You may also delete your wallet or export your wallet. Deleting your wallet means that your current wallet will be deleted and all data will be cleared. Only use this option when you are entirely clear about what you would like to do. If you delete your wallet, you can only recover the wallet using the recovery phrase.

Exporting your wallet allows you to view your recovery phrase so that you may use the AXS wallet on other wallet access services such as Metamask or Trezor. Please make sure to not share the recovery phrase with anyone.&#x20;

Lastly, you can toggle biometrics on and off to either make your app more convenient or more secure.
