# MXC Metaverse

**What is Metaverse?**\
Metaverse can be explained as open, secure, unique, free digital space created over an interoperable network layer. The metaverse can be understood as a virtual world, held and facilitated by the technology within the physical space that can host comprehensive and immersive media experiences. The Web 3.0 framework allows the application of metaverse into reality.



The metaverse is a construct of immersive technology, combining virtual reality and augmented reality technologies. These technologies integrate the physical world content into the virtual world to create an environment where users can engage naturally with blended reality. The metaverse will be an immersive online experience, enhancing the mixed reality environment that makes you feel like you are actually in the event.



**What is MXC Metaspace?**

The MXC metaverse will exist on top of the actual physical world, covering the entire globe. MXC’s vision is to use MXC metaspace as an expansion tool to grow the network, taking physical hardware such as LPWAN sensors and [M2 Pro Miners](https://matchx.io/pages/m2-pro-miner), and increasing their global network reach via improved mining power within a virtual world, imagine covering vast areas of the globe.&#x20;



Owning the hardware in the physical world will also give the owner exclusive perks in the MXC&#x20;



The MXC Foundation Metaverse will be a Multi-Token virtual world including Bitcoin, MXC, ETH, DHX, Polkadot, and various other tokens.



Moreover, the application of NFTs in the MXC metaverse will ensure individual hardware security and regional ownership. The owners of those NFTs will represent the scarcity in the virtual world, and it is this uniqueness will allow individuals to own virtual digital property rights. These held NFTs will enhance the large-scale coordination across Meta environments and applications that safeguard users’ NFT and Miner power and overall success.&#x20;
